### 1. FizzBuzz

Objective: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Hint: Use a loop to iterate through the numbers and conditional statements to check for multiples.

### 2. Palindrome Checker

Objective: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Hint: Convert the string to lowercase, remove non-alphanumeric characters, and compare it to its reverse.

### 3. Factorial Calculator

Objective: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

Hint: Use a loop to multiply the numbers from 1 to the input number.

### 4. Simple Calculator

Objective: Create a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should take two numbers and an operator as input and return the result of the operation.

Hint: Use conditional statements to determine which operation to perform based on the operator.

### 5. String Reversal

Objective: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

Hint: Use slicing to reverse the string.

These challenges cover a range of topics including loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and basic arithmetic operations. They should help you practice and improve your coding skills. Good luck!
