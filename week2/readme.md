# Solutions Summary

## Question 1: Fast Fourier Transformation

For question one, I used the `numpy` library for numerical operations and the `scipy.fft` library to compute the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). The FFT is a widely-used algorithm for efficiently computing the Fourier transform of a sequence of complex numbers. Here's how the solution works:

- **Approach**:
  - I utilized the `numpy` library for array manipulation and mathematical operations.
  - The `scipy.fft` library provides the `fft` function for computing the FFT.

- **Implementation**:
  - I defined a function `computeandPrintFFT(arr)` that takes an array of complex numbers as input and computes their FFT.
  - The function first checks if the input array is empty.
  - It then converts the input array into a numpy array.
  - Using the `fft` function from `scipy.fft`, the FFT of the input array is computed.
  - Magnitude and phase information for each component of the FFT result is extracted and printed.

- **Test Cases**:
  - I tested the function with custom test cases to validate its correctness and functionality.

## Question 2: Shortest Path Finding Using Breadth-First Search

For question two, I implemented a solution using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two words while considering valid transformations. Here's a summary of the solution:

- **Approach**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore all possible paths from a start node to a goal node.
  - In this case, words are treated as nodes, and valid transformations between words represent edges in the graph.

- **Implementation**:
  - I defined a function `shortest_sequence_length(start, end, words)` that takes a start word, an end word, and a list of words as input.
  - The function initializes a queue to store word sequences and a set to track visited words.
  - Using BFS, it explores all possible transformations from the start word to the end word while ensuring each transformed word exists in the given list.
  - If a valid transformation sequence is found, the function returns the length of the shortest sequence.
  - If no valid sequence exists, it returns -1.

- **Test Cases**:
  - I validated the function's correctness by testing it with custom test cases.

## Additional Notes

- Both solutions leverage efficient algorithms and libraries to accomplish their respective tasks.
- Error handling and edge cases are considered to ensure robustness and reliability.
- The code is designed for readability, maintainability, and scalability, adhering to best practices and principles of software engineering.
