# Week-2 Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Week-2 coding challenge This challenge is designed to test your skills in signal processing and algorithmic thinking. It consists of two parts: the Fourier Transform and the Word Ladder challenges.

## Fourier Transform Challenge

### Objective
Given a sequence of complex numbers, implement a function that performs a Fourier transform on the sequence using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

### Requirements
- The function should take as input a sequence of complex numbers.
- It should return the Fourier transform of the input sequence.
- You are allowed to use any programming language, but you must provide a clear explanation of your solution.

### Constraints
- The input sequence will contain at least one complex number.
- The output should be a sequence of complex numbers representing the Fourier transform of the input.

## Word Ladder Challenge

### Objective
Given two words and a list of words, implement a function that finds the length of the shortest sequence of transformations from the start word to the end word such that only one letter can be changed at a time, and each transformed word must exist in the given list of words.

### Requirements

- The function should take as input two words (the start and end words) and a list of words.
- It should return the length of the shortest sequence of transformations.
- You are allowed to use any programming language, but you must provide a clear explanation of your solution.

### Constraints
- The list of words will contain at least one word.
- The start and end words will be valid English words.
- The transformed words must exist in the given list of words.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your solution as a GitHub repository.
- Include a README file with your submission that clearly explains your solution, including any libraries or frameworks used.

## Evaluation Criteria
- must be follow the(brook7g) github profile
- must be member of the telegram channel `https://t.me/birukcodes` and invite 5 of his/her friends 
- Correctness of the solution.
- Efficiency of the solution.
- Code readability and organization.
- Use of comments to explain complex parts of the code.

Good luck with the challenge!
